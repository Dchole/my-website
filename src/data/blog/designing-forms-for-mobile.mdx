Designing forms for mobile can be a hiccup especially when it has many fields. I don’t know how many people know this; the on-screen keypad can cover your form or the submit button making it difficult for users to click thus disrupting the sign-in/sign-up flow.

## What I’m Working On

I’m rebuilding an old project, a forms app. The app has so many issues on performance, bugs, inappropriate loaders and **bad forms**, especially on mobile. I just built _something that worked_ but that wasn't enough. The app was responsive, yes but I didn’t know the effect of the on-screen keypad on forms. It was until I deployed and checked it on my phone before realising the bad.

## Better form for mobile

A good lesson I learnt from [an article I read](https://web.dev/sign-in-form-best-practices). Use multi-step form. You don’t have to crump everything on a single page.
